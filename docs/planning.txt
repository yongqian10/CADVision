CADVision proposal

Scope
-> create and build an inhouse vision software platform.
-> introduce flexibility and ease designing complex vision system

Problem with existing vision software Ni Vision
-> not in-house
-> poor processing performance

-> not modular
  -> unable to package existing design and reuse

-> not concurrent, single instance, single process

 -> cant perform algorithm involves multi frames automatically
    -> no 'masterplan' mode.

-> limited computing resources
  ->  not enough function supported in "calculator" directory

-> terminal not supported / unable to integrated with terminal

-> limited algorithm supported.
  -> tracking
    -> only traditional mean shift algo is available

-> limited simulation mode
  -> lighting simulation
  -> multiple angle simulation

-> no self defined/draw pattern

-> limited gui element
  -> should able to accept xml file

-> not allow to open multiple file/ project
  -> should be able to open(at least on read only mode)

-> self define coordinate point have to rely on an 'feature detected' make detection and calculation not consistent

-> missing/ mediocre 3D inspection support

Proposed method
-> enable "master" view intepretation.
-> multi instance processing.
-> design packaging and reuse
-> user free to add their own algorithm
-> simulation environment and layout
-> feedback to user(algorithm processing time, algorithm accuracy)
-> more user friendly app layout
-> introduce more algorithm
-> improve performance
-> user able to create their gui with xml file
-> embedded terminal into app

Project budget
-> utilizing free softwares only

Project flow
-> stage 1  initialization (3 months)
  -> build skeleton GUI with QT(C++)
  -> model algorithms

 -> stage 2 combining works
  -> link algorithms with GUI and perform testing
  -> get a working app

 -> stage 3 optimizing
  -> change python code to C++
  -> perform multithreading
